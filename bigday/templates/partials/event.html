                Well, it is actually going to be a bit after the real day D.
                We are officially getting married the day before to avoid unnecessary bureaucracy when it comes to marrying a foreigner.
            </p>
            <p>
                Sunday will then be a day to celebrate our international union with all our friends and enjoy the real party!
