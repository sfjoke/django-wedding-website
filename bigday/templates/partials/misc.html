                This is a paperless wedding.
                That means all of our save the dates, invitations, and thank-you notes are being delivered digitally.
            </p>
            <p>
                This is not really to save the planet (although it's cool), but rather to take advantage of the technology to reach everybody easily in different countries.
                We intend also to use this website to share pictures of the wedding.
                Thank you for your support and understanding!
